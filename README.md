# AquaDefender

This is my final project for university. An app that will protect the water resources with help of people.

Project Description:

The proposed project is a comprehensive web application developed using ASP.NET with Angular as the frontend framework and Microsoft SQL Server as the backend database. The primary objective of this project is to safeguard and monitor the quality of water in rivers, focusing on enabling users to report irregularities related to water bodies.

Key Features:

Incident Reporting:

Users will be able to submit reports through the application, highlighting any irregularities or issues observed in rivers and other water bodies.
The reports can include information such as pollution, waste disposal, or any other concerns affecting water quality.
Automated Notification System:

The application will have an automated notification system that sends emails to the relevant municipal authorities, specifically the local municipality and the Romanian National Water Administration, upon receiving a report.
The notifications will include details of the reported issue, aiding prompt response and resolution.
Water Quality Information:

Users will have access to information regarding the nutritional content of drinking water in their respective communities.
The application will provide data on the potability of water, allowing users to understand the quality and safety of the water they consume.
Visualization of Water Quality:

The application will include visual representations (graphs, charts) to showcase the nutritional values and drinkability status of water in a user-friendly manner.
Users can easily interpret and comprehend the data, promoting awareness about the water quality in their community.
User-Friendly Interface:

The interface will be intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate through the application, submit reports, and access information about water quality effortlessly.
Secure Data Handling:

Security measures will be implemented to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data, protecting user information and maintaining the credibility of reported incidents.
Multi-Level User Access:

The application will have different levels of access, with administrators having the authority to manage and respond to reported incidents, while regular users can submit reports and access water quality information.
By combining the power of ASP.NET, Angular, and Microsoft SQL Server, this project aims to create a robust and user-friendly platform that empowers communities to actively participate in monitoring and preserving the health of their local water bodies.
